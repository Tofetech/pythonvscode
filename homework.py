#Homework 1:
#Read any csv file and display as a dataframe


#Project Objective
# Create a student scores database which can 
# -get the name
# -4 subjects
# -calculate the average
# -calculate the grade (A,B,C,D,E,F) using the average
# -save and update your csv file

#import streamlit as st
#import pandas as pd #used to read a csv file and convert to a table (dataframe)

#What is a CSV file?
#A CSV file is a text file that each data is separated by a comma (comma separated values)

#df = pd.read_csv('scores.csv')
#st.dataframe(df)

#co-teacher Jeida will teach us the following:
# set the page to be full width X
# the dataframe on full width X
# add total, avearge and grade to also appear on CSV file X
# collect students data, save as dictionary and convert to a dataframe X
# overwrite the CSV file and display it X
#In the end of the class, student should be able to add the name and the scores and it all appears in the CSV file
